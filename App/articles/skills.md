# How to use a knife

Knife skills can mean the difference between getting all your prep done in five minutes or half an hour. Of course trying to go fast without the right technique is just asking for an accident.

Learn the "pinch grip" for holding a knife, you'll have much better control compared to the "pointer finger on the top of the knife" hold that every beginner does. Make sure your knife is reasonably sharp. It doesn't need to be Hattori Hanzo sharp, but you should never, ever have to force a knife through anything. A forced knife is a dangerous knife. Finally, under no circumstances should your fingers *ever* be under the blade of a knife. The "claw grip" will help keep your fingers out of harm's way.

# Mise en Place

This means do all your prep work, like cutting vegetables or mixing things in a bowl, *before* anything goes in the pan. But why? Wouldn't you be done faster if you started cooking one thing while chopping the next? Maybe one day, when cooking becomes second nature. If you're just starting out though, the last thing you want to do is divide your attention. You want to focus on cutting those vegetables, so you learn the right way to hold a knife. You want to focus on the food cooking in the pan, so you know when to lower the heat, when to stir, and when to add seasoning. 


Food gives all sorts of hints about how its cooking, but you won't pick up on any of them if you're not focused. By doing all the prep work ahead of time, you allow 100% of your focus to be directed at what's in front of you. 


Don't go overboard with mise en place, you don't need to be like TV chefs who put every single ingredient in its own small bowl. If things are going into the pan at the same time, put them on the same plate or in the same bowl.

# Taste as you go

Many a bland meal needs only a little salt to taste good, but how much should you add? There is no single answer, it depends too much on your tastes and what you're cooking. Instead, you should learn to *taste as you go*.

This simply means taste something, add a little salt, and taste again. You should notice the taste become a little stronger, up to a point. If you start to actually notice the salt itself, you've gone too far. If you only add a little at a time, you'll be unlikely to overshoot so far that you ruin the dish.

Tasting as you go doesn't just work for salt, it works for anything that adds flavor. Acids like lemon juice or vinegar can add another dimension of flavor to your dish, but add too much and they'll completely take over. So add a little bit at a time, tasting each step, until you dial in just the right taste.


# Aromatic Flavor Bases

Follow enough recipes and you'll notice a great many of them use onions and/or garlic, and they're almost always cooked in oil or butter in one of the very first steps of the recipe. This is because onion and garlic are some of the most versatile examples of *aromatics*. When you cook aromatics in a fat, like butter or oil, that flavor gets absorbed into the fat and makes everything else taste delicious.

What can be used as an aromatic? Anything that smells good when you cook it. Onions and their relatives (such as shallots, scallions, and leeks). Garlic is always welcome, but it burns easily so its often a good idea to add it later. Peppers of all sorts, everything from bell peppers to chili peppers. Ginger, which is often paired with garlic and scallions or leeks. Carrots and celery, which together with onion are called "mirepoix" and are perhaps the most well known aromatic base.
