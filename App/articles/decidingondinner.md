In today's world, millions of recipes are at your fingertips, for absolutely any cuisine or diet imaginable. Simply finding recipes is not a problem. The problem is how to choose what to make for dinner when there's such an overwhelming number of options.

How can you avoid decision fatigue, spend less time deciding what to eat and more time enjoying your food? The trick is to use a few good **anchors**.

# Anchoring your Decisions

Having choices is usually a good thing, but when you have too many of them, you can wind up being unable to make any decision at all. That's where anchors come in; an anchor limits your choices, and thus makes your decisions easier. For example: what kind of starch do you want with your meal? Rice? Pasta? Tortilla? Bread? Potato? Quinoa? Each of these options has plenty of recipes under it, so you'll probably be able to find one that fits your mood. However deciding on what rice dish you want is much easier than deciding between every possible kind of food you've ever eaten. 

# Examples of Anchors


- Main Starch: *Rice, Pasta, Tortilla, Bread, Pizza Dough, Dumpling Wrappers, etc…*
- Main Protein: *Chicken, Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Fish, Beans, etc…*
- Cooking Method: *Stovetop, Oven, Slow Cooker, Air Fryer/Convection Oven, Grill, Griddle, etc…*
- Type of Meal: *Soup, Stew, Sandwich, Taco, Stir Fry, etc…*
- Theme Days: *Meatless Monday, Taco Tuesday, Stir Friday, etc…*
- Dietary Restriction: *Low carb, Low calorie, Vegetarian, Vegan, etc…*
- Main Ingredient, especially if its one you have to use up while it's still good
- Cuisine

# Rotations

Let's say you're the kind of person who doesn't want to eat rice two days in a row. What you can do instead is take all the types of Main Starch that you like to eat, and give each one to a day of the week. Now, instead of choosing between rice, pasta, bread, etc, you're instead just picking what day you'll have rice, what day you'll have pasta, what day you'll have bread, and so on. Of course this plan is easily flexible, if on Wednesday you suddenly decide you're in the mood for pizza and not stir fry, there's no harm in switching days around.

# Combining Anchors

An anchor will limit your choices, making it easier to pick a recipe. However, even if you're committed to having a rice dish, there's still many kinds of rice dishes to choose from. It could be fried rice, or risotto, or jambalaya, or a curry, or anything under the Sun. However if you bring a *second* anchor into play, your circle of options narrows further. Say you decide it's going to be a soup. There's still plenty of soups that include rice, but because there's less to choose from, you'll have an easier time picking out a recipe.
