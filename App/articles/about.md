Pantrymo helps you find recipes you can cook with ingredients you already have, but unlike the many other websites and apps that do the same, this one favors recipes that use common, everyday ingredients. This means when you're trying to use up that last bit of of red bell pepper and chicken breast, you'll find recipes that won't have you going back to the store to find more obscure ingredients.

Using a library of several thousand recipes, Pantrymo knows how common various ingredients are among several cuisines. This lets the website rank recipes higher if they use common ingredients and lower if they call for more obscure things. The recipes themselves are provided by **Edamam** which provides access to 1.7 million recipes from reputable sources.

Pantrymo can help you to...
- **Decide what to eat:** Find new recipes you can cook, using ingredients you already have
- **Stop wasting food:** Find out what you can do with all those leftover ingredients from other recipes, instead of letting them go bad.
- **Stop buying ingredients you'll never use again:** Pantrymo favors recipes that use common, everyday ingredients.
- **Shop less, eat better:** Pantrymo will help you find recipes with what you already have in your kitchen, instead of making you dash to the store for that *one* ingredient you're missing.
