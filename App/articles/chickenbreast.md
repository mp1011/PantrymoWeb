Chicken Breast has a strange reputation in the pantheon of food. It is, hands down, the most popular cut of chicken. Yet at the same time, it's often considered bland, dry, and boring. Here is how you can get the most out of your chicken.

# First, make sure Chicken Breast is actually the cut you want to use

If the reason you reach for Breast is because that's what you've always used, consider giving thighs and drumsticks a chance. You might even find you like them better. Dark meat also has the advantage of being much easier to cook, it's higher fat content means it doesn't dry out as easily. If you are cooking for health, don't be scared off by that higher fat either, it's not *that* big of a difference and you can easily balance your calories in other ways.

# Salt it before cooking

Chicken Breast *does* have flavor, but you'd never know that if you didn't salt it before cooking. Remember, salt is not like herbs and spices that add flavors, instead salt enhances the flavors that are already there. If you have an hour to spare, you can salt your chicken ahead of time and give the salt the chance to work its way into the meat. Otherwise the next best option is to salt just before cooking.

How much salt to use will depend on your tastes. I recommend using coarse salt, such as kosher, because its easier to get a feel for how much to use by pinching it. Exactly what kind of coarse salt you use doesn't matter too much (stay away from the super expensive "finishing salts" though), but it does matter that you stick with the same kind and brand, as each is different.

# Cut and Dry

You'll want the surface of your chicken to be as dry as you can get it. Paper towels will usually suffice, just dab until most of the moisture is gone.

How you cut the chicken makes a big difference in how it cooks. That's because heat travels from the outside in, and the further it has to travel the longer it's going to take for the whole piece to be cooked through.

If you leave the breasts whole, you can easily overcook the outside by the time the inside is done. If you want to cook chicken this way, consider a two phase approach: a hot sear followed by a lower and slower method like baking.

By "[butterflying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G58F3MFVyFw)" the breast, you turn one thick piece into two thinner pieces. This means it will take less time to cook through so you're less likely to overcook it.

I don't recommend cubing chicken as it makes it harder to cook evenly, if you do want the chicken cubed in the final dish I recommend searing it whole, then letting it rest on the counter for a few minutes (it will not be cooked through at this point). Then cube it, and add it back to the pan to finish cooking.

# Brown it

Browning meat isn't just for show, it creates a deeper flavor in the meat. With the right kind of pan (that is, not non-stick), it can also leave brown bits in the pan, called a "fond", which carries a ton of flavor.

To get the best browning, you'll want your pan to be reasonably hot. How hot that is exactly depends on your stove, but its simply the highest setting you can do that doesn't burn the chicken. That might be all the way up but its more likely to be between halfway and three quarters of the way up the dial. You will need to do some trial and error to find out what exactly works for your pan and your stove.

You'll need fat to get browning, most cooking oils will do just fine but avoid using extra virgin olive oil or butter as they can burn easily if you're not careful.

Add the meat to the pan, without adding too much at once. If you overcrowd the pan, it can drop the temperature too much and you won't get good browning.

What you want to hear when you add your meat is a loud sizzle. This signals that the pan is hot enough and instantly evaporate any moisture that comes from the chicken. You don't want it to smoke, if that happens you've put your heat too high. If your pan isn't non-stick, the meat may fuse to the pan like it's been glued. **This is okay!** Do not force the meat to move, it will release from the pan on its own when that side is properly browned. You can even use this as a reliable indicator of when its time to flip. Try to nudge the piece and if it fights back at all, let it go a little longer.

The color of the meat when browned should be a deep golden brown color. You obviously don't want it blackened, and if its still pale it means you haven't formed a good crust yet.

# Don't overcook it

Dry chicken is overcooked chicken. Unlike thighs which benefit from long cook times, chicken breast will easily dry out if cooked too long. Traditional advice is to look at the color of the juices to tell when chicken is done, but this is highly unreliable. It's also commonly told that chicken must be cooked to 165&deg;F/74&deg;C, but this is poor advice for a number of reasons. First, the temperature of meat will continue to rise slightly as heat balances out between the hotter outside and the cooler middle. If you take your chicken out when the middle is 165&deg;, it will easily be several degrees more than that by the time it's plated. Second, the temperature of 165&deg; is simply the point in which all harmful bacteria die instantly. However it's not like bacteria has a jolly good time at 164&deg;, it also dies off, just more slowly. At around 155&deg;F/68&deg;C , it takes roughly a minute to kill off bacteria. For this reason, I aim for this temperature as I'm confident that the carry over cooking will keep it at least that temperature for the minute it needs.

After you have browned your chicken, it may or may not be fully cooked, depending on how thick it was. Either way, remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest on a plate while you continue on with the rest of the recipe. This will give the temperature of the chicken time to even out. You can then add the chicken back to the pan (preferably along with whatever other ingredients you are cooking) to let it heat through more gently until it reaches a safe temperature.

# Herbs and Spices

You may have noticed that, other than salt, I haven't mentioned a single herb or spice. That's because poorly cooked chicken combined with the best possible herbs and sauces is only going to be mediocre at best. Well prepared chicken has quite a lot of flavor on its own, but even then you'll surely want to enhance it with other spices.

Which spices? That's the nice thing about chicken, it gets along with so many different flavors that you can hardly find a herb or spice that *doesn't* play nicely with chicken. Refer to recipes for ideas of what combinations to use and it what amounts, but the important thing is to get the flavor of the chicken right so that the herbs and spices enhance it, rather than make up for any blandness.

I like to avoid adding things before browning the chicken, so I don't burn my spices. I generally add them after the meat has been seared and I've lowered the heat of the pan.
