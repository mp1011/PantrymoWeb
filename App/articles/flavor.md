You know what foods you like, but you might not be able to say exactly why. Or you might try a recipe and find it lacking, but you can't say exactly what's missing. If you don't understand the basics of flavor, you're rolling the dice every time you cook a recipe.

# The Three Pillars of Flavor: Taste, Aroma, and Mouthfeel

*Flavor* is a complicated sensation, which can be mostly broken down into three parts: 
* **Taste:** percieved by the tongue, includes sweetness, sourness, saltiness, savoriness, and bitterness.
* **Aroma:** percieved by the nose, it involves more kinds of chemicals than you can count and makes up most of the "personality" of an ingredient
* **Mouthfeel:** the physical sensation of the food, such as whether its crunchy, chewy, tender, thick, thin, warm, or cool.

There are other factors to how much you will enjoy a meal, but Taste, Aroma, and Mouthfeel will be the biggest reasons why a meal will succeed or fail. 

# Taste

The very first ingredient you should master is salt. That's because salt isn't a spice, it's not there to add its own flavor. Instead, it's there to amplify the flavors that are already there. This makes adding salt like adjusting the volume of a song, it doesn't change the song, only how well you can experience it. If a meal is bland, the lack of salt is likely the culprit.

Use too little salt and the meal will be boring, use too much and the salt will overwhelm the flavor. In fact this rule applies to all of the tastes, the only difference being the amount that qualifies as acceptable. Use the [taste as you go](/articles/skills#taste-as-you-go) technique to dial in just the right amount of salt. 

After salt, the next taste to master is sour, or acidic flavors. This includes lemon and lime juice, vinegar, pickes, sour cream, yogurt, and anything else with some tang to it. A little acid is said to "brighten" a dish and can add a little excitement to the flavor profile. But add it with a careful hand, too much acid can easily take over the flavor and ruin the dish.

Umami, or the savory flavor, has long been a popular buzzword, but its simply one of the basic tastes that the tongue can detect. Umami can give food a deep, meaty flavor. While it can be added directly in the form of MSG (which is perfectly safe as long as you don't have a specific medical intolerance to it), many popular ingredients are also rich in umami like meat, cheese, tomatos, and mushrooms.

Sweetness, like sourness, works well as a balancing accent to an otherwise salty/savory dish. Salt and sweet enhance each other, whether you're talking about dinner or dessert. It can also counter acidic and bitter flavors.

Bitterness is easily the most undesirable flavor and something you will rarely want to add directly. However a little bitter can balance a dish that would otherwise be too rich and heavy.

# Aroma

A lemon is more than sour, a strawberry is more than sweet, a strip of bacon is more than salty and savory. When it comes to what makes any given food taste like itself, the answer is aroma.

When it comes to the chemistry behind it, taste is comparatively simple. Each taste is your tongue detecting a certain kind of molecule. A handful of molecules make up a majority of what your tongue senses. Aroma, on the other hand, is the result of sensing thousands of kinds of molecules. And since its the *combination* of molecules that matters more so than anything else, that means the total number of unique aromas is astronomically vast. 

So how can you possibly know what aromas work well together? Thankfully, you have a few thousand years of culinary experimentation to guide you. Cuisines are, in part, defined by particular kinds of aromas. If you look at enough recipes for a particular cuisine, you'll see some ingredients used over and over again.

In particular, look for the [aromatic flavor bases](/articles/skills#aromatic-flavor-bases) used in a cuisine. Cook aromatics in some kind of fat, and those pleasing aromas will become infused into the fat and will form a basis of flavor for the whole dish.


# Mouthfeel

Texture is often overlooked as an element of flavor, but even if the taste and aroma are spot on, the wrong texture can completely ruin a meal.

You can put all the different texture of food on a line according to how much they work the jaw. In the middle you have tender foods, like bread, rice, pasta. On the low end you have pure liquids like juices and broths. On the high end you have crispy, crunchy, and chewy foods that put the jaw muscles to work. A good meal has a proper balance of all of these.

Think of **Tender** foods as your home. We find tender foods to be familair and comforting. It's easily the most prominent texture in savory meals, and one reason why bread, rice, and pasta are so massively popular. Tender foods have that perfect balance: not so soft that they don't need to be chewed, not so firm that they put the jaw to work.

If Tender is home, think of **Crunchy**, **Crispy**, and **Chewy** as a vacation. Home is nice, but sometimes you want a change of scenery. These textures are exciting and different, which is why they're so prominent in snack foods. As nice as vacations are, after a while you just want to be back home in your own bed, and so these kinds of foods work best as an occassional break from the tender texture.
