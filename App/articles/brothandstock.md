What's the difference between **broth** and **stock**? It's one of those questions where the more you look into it, the less clear the answer is. Everyone seems to have their own opinion about where to draw the line. At the risk of spoiling the end of the article, no I will not imbue upon you the Correct™ and True™ definitions of Stock and Broth, as doing so would only be add to the confusion. Instead, I will show that, in most cases, asking "What's the difference between broth and stock?" is asking the wrong question.

# Can I substitute broth for stock?

One reason why you might want to know the difference between broth and stock is to know if you could swap one for the other in a recipe. If a recipe calls for chicken stock, but all you have on hand is a carton of chicken broth, can you use it? It's a perfectly honest question, if a recipe called for milk and all you had on hand was orange juice, you'd be quite correct in assuming that using it as a substitute would lead to a bad time. Asking this question, however, assumes that broth and stock are two very different, and very distinct things.

There are many, many recipes that call themselves "chicken broth" or "chicken stock". Each may have different aromatics, different herbs, different cook times, or different techniques. Each is unique in its own way, but no matter what path the author took in writing the recipe, the result is a a chicken-flavored liquid. Unless you know the chef who made it, knowing that something is called *broth* or *stock* conveys absolutely no useful information. The only thing you can very reliably know is that if something is called "X Stock" or "X Broth" its going to be a liquid with the flavor of "X", among other things.

What *does* matter, however, is whether or not this liquid has been salted. If the recipe assumed you'd be adding an unsalted liquid, and you use a fully salted one, the result will be a way oversalted dish.

# What about bones and meat?

A very common answer to what separates stock from broth is that stock has bones, while broth has meat. This definition, though, raises more questions than it answers. What if its made with bones *and* meat? What about vegetable stock and mushroom stock? You could of course live of your life believing that everyone who uses the term "vegetable stock" is wrong and go to bed smug in your linguistic superiority every night, but the fact is we live in a world where "vegetable stock" is a perfectly acceptable term.

Both bones and meat serve a very particular purpose. Bones (or more broadly, bones and connective tissue), supply collagen, which gives the liquid a distinct mouthfeel and causes it to become a solid gel when cooled (every time a cook is baffled that their chicken stock/broth turned to jello in the fridge, a culinary angel gets its wings). It takes a long time to extract (unless you have a pressure cooker), and thus many people say the difference between broth and stock is that stock is simmered for much longer.

As important as collagen is though, bones on their own aren't very tasty. The real chicken flavor in a chicken stock/broth, for example, comes from chicken. When meat or vegetables are simmered in a liquid, they give up some of their flavor to the liquid, and the longer you go, the more flavor is extracted. At some point, so much flavor is in the liquid that the solids no longer have much use. If this is your goal, you will want to strain and discard all solid matter from your stock, leaving only the flavorful liquid behind.

Instead of asking whether something is a broth or a stock, a better question is "do I want to serve only the liquid, or the liquid and the ingredients?". Nobody wants bones in their chicken soup, but a carrot could go either way. Simmer it long enough and that carrot will have given up all its value to the broth, but simmer it for less time and you'll have a nice tender and tasty carrot in a broth that has just a hint of carrot flavor.

# Isn't stock an ingredient, and broth a finished product?

Another popular answer to the question is to say that "stock" is more of a building block, whereas "broth" is the final result that you intend to serve your guests. This fits quite well with the popular usage of "broth"; ask any random person on the street to describe "broth" to you and they're likely to say its the liquid part of a soup, whereas if you ask the same random person to describe "stock" they'll be just as likely to think you're asking about finance. Under this definition, stock and broth aren't exactly two different things, but rather two different stages of the same journey.

Start some bones and aromatics in water, and you'll have what everyone would call "stock". After several hours and much culinary hustle, someone will be served a bowl of soup, and everyone will call that liquid a "broth". When exactly did the switch happen? It's a bit of a pointless question, much like asking the precise moment in which "batter" becomes "cake". If you really wanted to know how far along the recipe is, you'd never ask "has the stock turned into broth yet?"

# Is there anything we can all agree on?

There is absolutely a difference between broth and stock, its just that everyone has a slightly different idea of what that difference is. Still, what broth and stock have in common is far more important. Each is a flavorful liquid, which can become a soup, or used as a cooking medium, or thickened into a sauce. There is never a time however when the *difference* between the two has any real culinary value.

# And what is "Bone Broth"?

It's simply a catchy term, which you could easily call a stock or a broth. You could say its a stock, simmered longer than usual, that's intended as a hot beverage.
