Everyone knows how to read a recipe right? You look at the words and do what the words say, end of story. But if you believe that, you might also be the kind of cook who wonders why every recipe takes three times as long as it should and never turns out right.

Recipes have a lot going on between the lines, and if you haven't learned to pick up on these signals your cooking can become chaotic and stressful. Here's a few tips to make recipes spill their secrets.

# Make sure you have all the tools and ingredients you need

This is especially important for equipment, as recipes rarely tell you what tools you'll need except in the directions themselves. Nobody wants to be at step 7 of a 13 step recipe only to find their blender isn't clean. Gather everything you need, so when the recipe asks you to shake in a few drops of hot sauce, you don't have to walk across the kitchen and search through your cabinets to find it.

# Look for time-consuming preparations

The recipe may tell you to only bake the food for 15 minutes, or boil the vegetables for just sixty seconds. But that doesn't include the time it takes to preheat that oven or to get that pot of water to a boil. The recipe may assume your ingredients are room temperature, or even worse, have already been marinating for 24 hours.

Thankfully, preheating an oven or setting a pot of water to boil are no-brainer tasks. So start them right away, and by the time you're finished putting everything else together, it will be ready.

# Look for instructions inside the ingredients list

Recipes will commonly include the preparation of ingredients right in the ingredients list. So instead of telling you to chop onions in the directions, it will instead call for "Half an onion, chopped".

All of these instructions are basically your *"mise en place"*, which is the very common idea of having everything organized and ready to go before you ever heat up the pan. In cooking shows and in professional kitchens, each ingredient may be put into its very own container, but you don't need to go this far in the home kitchen. Simply having all your ingredients "ready to go" is all you need.

# Times and heat levels are relative

Beginners want precision, they haven't yet learned how to control heat and just want the recipe to tell them how hot, for how long. Unfortunately this often results in the unlucky cook burning, or undercooking, their dinner because their stove was hotter or cooler than the recipe assumed.

To get around this, every home cook needs to "find their medium", or the level on their stove where food doesn't burn, but also doesn't take forever to cook. This will probably be somewhere close to the middle of the dial, so that's a good place to start, but on a stronger stove the middle may be too hot, and on a weaker stove it may be too cool.

No good recipe will ever give a single time for anything, you'll almost always see a range. Better recipes will even tell you other cues to tell if the food is done, and of course if you want the final word on temperature, you can't beat an instant read thermometer. If a recipe says something should cook for 15-20 minutes, that means you should start checking after 15 minutes. Is the food tender enough, crispy enough, browned enough, or whatever effect it's going for? If so, you're done, if not, keep cooking. It might even take longer than 20 minutes.

# "Season to Taste" is serious business

Many recipes will ask you add salt, pepper, or other seasonings "to taste". This can be confusing to new cooks who are used to seeing precise measurements, but "to taste" is actually a specific technique. It means you should taste the food, then add a little seasoning, and taste again. You should notice the flavor improve. If it hasn't improved enough, add more. The trick is to learn how much of an ingredient to add so you don't overdo it, as it's hard to recover from adding too much seasoning. Thankfully there is a fairly wide acceptable range so as long as you aren't dumping in ingredients with reckless abandon, you'll probably hit the right levels.
