The most confusing time for a cook is when you are first starting out. There's so much to learn, so many recipes, so many chefs, so many pieces of equipment, that it can easily become overwhelming.


# At first, it's more about luck than talent

So you tried out this whole "cooking" thing, and it didn't go so well. Yet others seem like they can just breeze through cooking with no problems. They might even say cooking is easy, which makes it sound like you just don't have the natural gift of cooking. But talent isn't something you're born with. 

When you don't yet understand the rules of cooking, it's like walking through a minefield. Some people will be fortunate enough to stroll right through, they might even gloat about how easy it was. All they had to do was walk! It doesn't mean they know where the mines are, they simply were lucky enough to find a path that didn't cross any of them.

Maybe your stove is hotter than the recipe expected. Maybe your oven runs cooler. Maybe you have a different kind of pan. Maybe your vegetables are more or less fresh. Maybe you're very sensitive to some flavors, or not sensitive enough. Maybe you didn't realize there were different kinds of an ingredient and you got the wrong one. There's all sorts of things that can make a recipe fail even if you follow a recipe to the letter.

If you randomly walk about the culinary minefield, you might eventually be lucky enough to make it to the other side. You now have a "path" to cooking. Is it the best path? Is it the only path? Of course not, but now there's something you can comfortably do. Maybe its scrambling eggs, or crock pot meals, or doctoring up instant ramen. Try and find your "thing" where you are free to cook without fear of messing up.

# Sometimes you'll fail, and that's okay

Fear of failure stops many people from even trying. What if you try to make dinner, and it doesn't work? You've then wasted money and time, and all you have to show for it is a sink full of dirty dishes and pots.

Instead of being afraid of failure, welcome it as a learning experience. You *will* miss your mark from time to time, but if you learn a lesson from those mistakes then nothing was wasted. As they say, *"the master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried"*.

That aside, you can hedge your bets by staying away from very complicated recipes until you get a hang for the basics. If you try and cook something too far beyond your level, there will be so many moving parts that you won't even know what you did wrong if the meal comes out bad.

# Take all "rules" with a grain of salt


If you post any opinion about food to social media, you'll almost surely attract gatekeepers. Those who tell you you didn't *really* make that recipe because you used the wrong ingredients, those who judge you for the way you like your food, those who take any deviation from their norms as an insult. This leads to the common belief that cooking is rife with rules and if you don't memorize and follow all of them you are less of a cook.

Rules aren't always bad, every chef has their own set of rules they follow that determines their particular style. Some rules will legitimately improve your cooking. However many are just preference, and some are just a product of their time and place in culinary history.


# Above all, just cook something


Cooking may be overwhelming at first, but it will only get easier as you get used to the motions. The worst thing you can do is avoid cooking, or try to just get it over with, because then you won't have a chance to build your intuition. 

It's often asked what the best way to learn cooking is, but there is no best answer because it depends so heavily on your personality, your preferences, and your constraints. The only way you're going to learn what's best for you is to try.
